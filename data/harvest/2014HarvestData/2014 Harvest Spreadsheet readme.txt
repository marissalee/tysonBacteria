2014 Harvest Spreadsheet readme

Species: 4-letter code
Symbol: 
Plot
Pull date: date that the sample was pulled from the plot
Picture ID: identifying information for the picture(s) of the sample
Fruiting bodies (y/n): indicates presence of fungal fruiting bodies on sample
Fungal ID: if fruiting bodies are present, this field contains a putative ID
Wet weight excess: pre-drying wet weight of excess material that fell off of the sample before drilling.
Wet weight log: pre-drying and pre-drilling wet weight of the log
WW total (g): pre-drying and pre-drilling wet weight of the entire sample (drilled material + excess) - weight of tacks in sample
Post-drill WW w/tacks: weight of drilled sample material; includes weight of tacks in sample
Post-drill Wet Weight (g) = (Post-drill WW w/tacks - weight of tacks); does NOT include weight of excess material
Dry weight excess: dry weight (105C) of excess material that was removed from log before drilling [NOTE: this value = 0 for all samples pulled on 6/2/14, 6/3/14, and 6/4/14 because excess was weighed for dry mass WITH the main sample. For these samples, dry weight log = dry weight.)
Dry weight log: dry weight (105C) of drilled sample material
Dry weight: summed dry weight (105C) of dry weight (excess) and dry weight log, minus tack weight
Dry weight for volume: dry weight (105C) of the sample used to estimate sample volume
Volume (kg): water displacement by sample
Absorption (-kg): weight (kg) left on balance after removing sample from water
Date in oven: date the sample was placed in the 105C oven
Date out oven: date the sample was removed from the 105C oven
Tacks: number of tacks left in the sample during processing
Tack mass (g) = number of tacks in sample multiplied by the average weight of a single tack (see "Tack mass" sheet)
DWWW Ratio = Dry weight log (g)/Post-drill Wet Weight (g) [NOTE: tack mass subtracted before ratio]
DM(105) = DWWW Ratio * WWTotal(g) [NOTE: tack mass subtracted]
MC = moisture content = (Post-Drill Wet Weight - Dry weight log)/Post-Drill Wet Weight * 100
Burned: Y/N; indicates if a piece was in the drying oven during the fire (==Y)

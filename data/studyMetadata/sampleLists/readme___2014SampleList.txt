## Description: Sample lists from Tyson rotplots in 2014 harvest

## Origin: Google Drive/Zanne Lab/2014 harvest/

## Format: Excel

## Worksheet 1: main
## Description: Sample IDs collected in the main rotplot experiment. Set up as a grid so that samples that were collected have the sample id filled into that cell.  Samples that were not collected for some reason have "NA". If a wood sample no longer had a distinguishable "top" and "bottom", then the sample id has an "_" in place of the "t/b". 
## Columns...
Sp : wood species code
Yrs : number of years that wood sample has been decaying
Side : location on the log, either top (t) or bottom (b)
1L, 1H, 2L, 2H, 3L, 3H, 4L, 4H : Plot ID


## Worksheet 2: bagged
## Description: Sample IDs collected for the bagged study, an extension on the rot plot experiment. Set up as a grid so that samples that were collected have the sample id filled into that cell.
## Columns...
Sp : wood species code
Yrs : number of years that wood sample has been decaying
Side : location on the log, either top (t) or bottom (b)
1L, 1H, 2L, 2H, 3L, 3H, 4L, 4H : Plot ID


## Modifications:
MRL changed the file name from "2014 Sample List" to "2014SampleList" to make it consistent with the other file names

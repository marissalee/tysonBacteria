## Description: Barcode to Sample ID look up table for 2012 harvest microbial data

## Origin: Research Drive: Zanne Lab/TysonAmplicon_Run2014/Identified_Barcodes_samples.txt

## Format: Txt

## Columns...
Barcode : MiSeq Illumina barcode given to each sample
Sample : Sample ID
16S : ? 
ITS : ?
LSU : ?


## Notes:
The difference between "Identified_Barcodes_samples" and "Identified_Barcodes_samples_Corrected" is that the "..._Corrected" file had typos in Amy Milo's samples.  Samples other than Amy Milo's have not been checked for typos.
Note that the sequencing run was in 2014, but the microbial data came from the 2012 harvest.

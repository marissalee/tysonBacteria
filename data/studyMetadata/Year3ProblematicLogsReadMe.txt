Logs with problematic info from year 3 harvest

a.      PIST 1-B All plot maps say 1-b old & new.  As you said, the
original datasheet does not have 1-b listed.  That leaves two
possibilities.  Either the label was transcribed incorrectly or the
original data were not entered for this log.  If transcription error
was the problem, the most likely originals were 2-1-b & 3-1-b.  PIST
3-1-b is supposed to still in the field at 4".  PIST 2-1-b is not
listed on the old or new plot maps.  However, the rotted log that we
have is bigger than 2-1-b (problem log 5.5-6 cm diam versus barely 5
for 2-1-b), so it canâ€™t possibly be 2-1-b. The most likely explanation
is that the original data were not recorded but the log was deployed
anyways.  Our best bet would be to reconstruct this logs mass from (1)
the volume calculated from the diameters of adjacent logs [the larger
diameter for 1-a because the problem log has branches at one end] and
the average log length for this species, (2) the average dry mass to
volume relationship for this species.

SOLUTION: I took the average of all PIST1 lengths (=21 cm). I averaged the x and y diameters each for 1C (=6.05) and took the larger of the diameters for 1A (=6.3). I then averaged these two diameters (=6.175 cm). The estimated volume for PIST1-B is (=628.9021797 cm^3). For all PIST1 stems, I averaged the x and y diameters and calculated the volume. I then predicted wet mass from volume and got the following equation with an R^2=0.95, wet weight=0.7034*volume-5.455. The estimated wet weight for PIST1-B is then (=436.9147932 g). See the file (Decomp PIST 1B Estimated Log Length Diameter Weight.xlsx)

To compare mass loss for other PIST1 logs, there were two harvested from Year 1 but only one from Year 3 (i.e., the problematic log).
Year 1 harvest: 2L (1A), 3L (1F)
Year 3 harvest: 2L (1B)

b.      AMAR 3-E from 2L.  Dry weight seems correct.  The initial mass
listed in the datasheet is 61.81g.  We agree that this was a typo.  We
might try to use the same strategy suggested above to reconstruct the
initial wet mass for this species.

SOLUTION: Use the estimated initial wet mass of 719.5522034 estimated in the file Decomp AMAR 3E Wet Weight Estimate.xlsx

c.      CEOC 3-J.  This log is on the maps twice, once in 3-h once in 1-l.
The original plot map for 3-H has CEOC 1-L listed but corrected by us
last year to 3-J.  The tag from this log clearly had 1-L at first and
then scratched out and written over to 3-J.  We checked the
dimensional measurements and the CEOC 3-J log from 3-H was consistent
with log 1-L.  We think the team made a mistake in year 0.

1L: CEOC 3J -> CEOC 3J
3H: CEOC 3J -> CEOC 1L

d.      New RT masses are very close to the masses recorded:
i.      Gltr 2-c (4L) 38.0
ii.     Divi 3-I (4L) 33.16
iii.    Cofl 2-F (4L) 33.51
iv.     ASTR 1-A (2L) 61.91
These were the most decayed logs.  Darcy reports that all were
basically dust when re weighed.

SOLUTION: Leave as is.
